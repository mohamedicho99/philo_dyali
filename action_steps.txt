init extra data
	// almost done
start dinner 
	(once the thread is created the philo will start his routine)
	// create threads
		-> philos and monitors 
	// join threads
		-> philos and monitors 
	(join helps telling the process for the threads to kinda finish doing their job)

start building philo routine
	from there you'll get to:
		check turn 
		start cycle
	
start with:
	check starvation
		the monitor needs to call this one and it does every time
			(anwser this: how often does it call it?)
	check fullness

-> what happens when start cycle return NULL? 
	does the pthread create fail?
	how does the program terminate itself from this point!
	no flow chart needed her! be concise
